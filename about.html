        <h1><strong>ABOUT MIRACLE ELVIS</strong></h1>
        <p>Miracle Elvis ifesinachi is a journalist and a tech enthusiast. He studies English Literature at Obafemi Awolowo University, Osun State where he is a member of the Association of Campus Journalists. His love for storytelling has resulted in him doing so in several forms: short stories, film scripts, news reports, poetry and computer codes. He aims to raise conversations with his works around the subjects of family dynamics, hunger and faith in Africa. His works have been published in ARISE News Global, WE NAIJA Anthology by Nigeria Solidarity Support Fund,  Shuzia "Unseen" Anthology and other platforms.</p>

        <p>He is also a lover of spoken word poetry and considers it an art form he adores but is unworthy of creating. When he is not working or googling Marsai Martin, he attends spoken word grand slam events.</p>
